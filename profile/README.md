## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Prephouse. We are part of the UWaterloo Computer Engineering class of 2022, and this is our Final Year Design Project.

#### Introduction

Millions of qualified people perform poorly in interviews and presentations due to inadequate interpersonal skills. They have the domain expertise but cannot convey their ideas clearly and coherently. Prephouse lets users gain confidence and skill in their ability to perfect interviews and presentations. Our machine learning driven platform analyzes video and audio characteristics of practice session recordings in order to provide actionable feedback, benchmarks and scores. Without the cost and hassle of real-time coaching, our users can grow their skills asynchronously at their own pace.
